I already had experiences to develop many projects, which are based on as3.0. In my past experiences, I built many interactive websites and mobile applications for mobile and desktop that I familiarly used other frameworks such as Starling , FeatherUI, TweenMax. Moreover, I understand some design softwares such as Photoshop and sketch to process layout materials as well.
I believe Visual Reality/ Augmented Reality will bring a huge potential in the future. Therefore, I started to explore VR/AR sphere with related program languages such as C# on Unity3D engine.
